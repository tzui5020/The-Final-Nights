Their high levels of Rage put them on the edge at all times - the Full Moon's blessing is a hair trigger, among other things. Those closer to the waxing moon tend to exult in the glory of the war, while those closer to the waning moon are more viciously pragmatic, ruthless in their bloodthirst. Every Ahroun is a dangerous individual to be around, but when the forces of the Wyrm attack, their packmates are glad to have a Full Moon warrior at the front of the charge."

While all Galliards are prone to immense mirth and immense melancholy, those born under a waning moon fall more readily into dark, consuming passions; they are the tragedians of the Garou, mastering tales of doom, ruin, sacrifice and loss. Conversely, their waxing-moon cousins sing of triumph and conquest, of the pounding heart and the love of life. They tend to be the soul of their pack's morale - when the Galliard is willing to go on, so too are all the others."

Those born under the waxing Half Moon may seem unusually serene and disaffected, their emotions only emerging when their Rage comes to a boil. The waning-moon Philodox is more incisive and judgmental, his all-seeing eye always carefully watching his packmates and colleagues for any departure from the expected. The Half Moons' opinions are somewhat feared, yet highly respected - a word of praise or condemnation means much coming from those born to see both sides of every struggle."

Those Theurges born under the waning moon frequently have a harsher, more adversarial relationship with the spirit world - they tend to excel at binding and forcing spirits to their will, and are more vicious when battling spirits. Theurges born under the waxing moon tend to be more generous and open with the spirits, charming and cajoling rather than intimidating and threatening."

It's a rare Ragabash indeed that lacks a keen wit and the capacity to find some humor in any situation, no matter how bleak. Many other werewolves are slow to take the Ragabash seriously, though, as it's difficult to tell the difference between a New Moon's mockery that points out a grievous flaw in a plan and similar mockery that simply amuses him. Sometimes a Ragabash points out that the emperor has no clothes - but sometimes they're the first to cry wolf, so to speak."
