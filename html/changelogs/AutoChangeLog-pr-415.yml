  - rscadd: "A placeholder Corax \"Tribe\", that allows people to play the new Fera. This is EXTREMELY barebones and is currently a new flavour of Garou. Note that many features (flying, specific gifts) are missing. You are encouraged to help out and make your own PRs to add features, if you wish!"
  - rscadd: "Corax-Specific cawing emotes and transformation effects! Sound courtesy of Machinepixie on Discord"
  - rscadd: "Corax-Specific breed HUD elements, sprites made by Boltersam on discord"
  - rscadd: "Two Corax specific gifts : Eye Drinking and Sun's guard! Massive thanks to Machinepixie for the code!"
